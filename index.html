            <p>
                I’m a software engineer and game developer passionate about blending technical precision with captivating visuals. 
                My work focuses on creating experiences that are as aesthetically pleasing as they are functional, whether I’m designing interactive gameplay mechanics or building dynamic user interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                I recently earned my master’s degree in computer science while working on diverse projects, including building engaging learning platforms, crafting Unity shaders for visually immersive games, and experimenting with procedural art and graphics. 
                My favorite work often lies at the crossroads of design, engineering, and storytelling, where I can bring ideas to life in innovative and visually compelling ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past, I’ve collaborated on projects ranging from educational technology to creative gaming systems. 
                I also enjoy solving complex technical challenges, such as rendering real-time graphics, improving UI/UX experiences, and integrating seamless backend systems.
